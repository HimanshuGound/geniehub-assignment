# What is GitHub
-> GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development version control using Git. It offers a range of features to help developers collaborate on projects, manage code, and track changes.

 ### Version Control:
 - Version Control: GitHub is built around Git, a distributed version control system. It allows developers to track changes to their codebase, create branches for features or fixes, and merge changes back into the main codebase.
   
 ### Code Hosting:
 - Developers can host their Git repositories on GitHub, making it accessible to collaborators and contributors worldwide. Repositories can be public (visible to everyone) or private (accessible only to specified collaborators).
  
 ### Integration:
 - GitHub integrates with a wide range of third-party tools and services, including continuous integration (CI) platforms, code analysis tools, and deployment services. This allows developers to automate workflows and streamline the development process.

 ### Documentation:
 - GitHub allows developers to create and host documentation for their projects using Markdown, a lightweight markup language. Documentation can include guides, tutorials, and API references, making it easier for users and contributors to understand and use the software.


## What is Git
- Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that helps developers track changes to their codebase and collaborate with others on software development projects.
-  Git is an open-source project originally created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. It is maintained and developed collaboratively by a global community of contributors and is freely available for anyone to use and contribute to.
