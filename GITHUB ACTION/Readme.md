## What is GitHub Action
GitHub Actions is a powerful workflow automation and CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tool provided by GitHub. It allows you to automate various tasks directly within your GitHub repository, such as building, testing, and deploying your code.

### How to implement CI/CD Pipeline?

#### Setting up a Workflow:
- In your GitHub repository, navigate to the "Actions" tab.
- Click on "Set up a workflow yourself" to create a new workflow file.
- GitHub Actions workflows are defined using YAML syntax in .github/workflows directory in your repository.

#### Defining Workflow Triggers:
- Specify when the workflow should run using triggers. For example, you can trigger the workflow on every push to a specific branch (push event) or when a pull request is opened or updated (pull_request event).

#### Defining Jobs and Steps:
- Define one or more jobs within your workflow. Each job represents a set of tasks that should be executed.
- Inside each job, define a series of steps. Steps are individual actions that perform specific tasks, such as checking out code from the repository, running tests, building artifacts, or deploying to a server.

#### Configuring Actions:
- GitHub Actions provides a wide range of built-in actions that you can use in your workflows. These actions cover various tasks such as running commands, publishing artifacts, sending notifications, and interacting with external services.
- You can also create custom actions or use actions contributed by the GitHub community.
#### Deploying Artifacts:
- After the build and test steps, you can include deployment steps to deploy your application to a server, cloud platform, or container registry.
- Use appropriate actions or commands to deploy your artifacts securely.
#### Example Workflow for CI/CD:
```
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build and deploy
        run: |
          npm run build
          # Add deployment steps here
```

#### Monitoring and Notifications:
- Optionally, you can include steps to send notifications or alerts based on the outcome of the workflow, such as success, failure, or specific conditions.

#### Workflow Configuration:
- Customize your workflow configuration based on your project's requirements, such as specifying environment variables, secrets, or conditional logic.

#### Testing and Iteration:
- Test your workflow by pushing changes to your repository and observing the workflow's execution.
- Iterate on your workflow configuration as needed to optimize performance, reliability, and security.
