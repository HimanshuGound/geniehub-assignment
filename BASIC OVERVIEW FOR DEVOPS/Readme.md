## What is DevOps:

DevOps is a teamwork approach that combines developers and operations to create and manage software smoothly. It uses automation to make repetitive tasks easier and faster. Continuous Integration (CI) ensures developers' code changes are regularly tested and merged. Continuous Delivery (CD) automates sending these changes to users quickly and safely. DevOps listens to user feedback and monitors software performance to fix issues promptly. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) simplifies setting up and managing servers and networks. It fosters a culture of learning, sharing, and improving within teams. Overall, DevOps aims to make software development and deployment faster, more reliable, and more efficient.
